#Ecommerce Dashboard UI

This repo contains an administration panel for an online store, which allows users to create and manage products and categories, view customer orders, and perform other related tasks. The user interface (UI) is built using NextJS with TypeScript and TailwindCSS, while the backend API can be found in this other repository -> https://github.com/jorgezerpa/dashboard-ecommerce (You will need both to run the project). This app is build with the best code practices, so you can take it as an starter for any similar project you want to build.

## How to run project Locally?

1. Clone this repository 
```
https://github.com/jorgezerpa/dashboard-api.git
```

1. Install all dependencies **(preferibly use clean installation)**
```
npm ci 
```
or
```
npm install 
```

1. create a __.env__ file on the root folder and set the needed variables. (You will find enviroment variables information on the **.env.example** file).

1. This project is a fullStack app. Since that, you need to download the API to be able to run things locally. You can found it [here](https://github.com/jorgezerpa/dashboard-ecommerce) with a setup guide.

1. Once you have the API installed and running,  you can start the project with the command:
```
npm run dev
```

1. THAT'S ALL! here you can see the [documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17956788/2s8Z6x3DhN) of the core API.

### Happy coding my friend :)
